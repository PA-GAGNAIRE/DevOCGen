    "An **Identity By Descent (IBD) segment** refers to a continuous genomic segment that is shared identical between two individuals' chromosomes because it was inherited from a common ancestor without recombination. \n",

    "The **distribution of IBD segment lengths** contains important information about demography. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to **Palamara et al. (2012)**, the expected length distribution of IBD segments can be derived analytically using the distribution of TMCRA (which depends only on demography) and the distribution of recombination distances. \n",
    "Therefore, **demography and recombination can be treated separately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Background from Palamara et al. 2012:\n",
    "For a pair of haplotypes that coalesce at time $t$ generations ago, the length of the resulting shared IBD segment is **only dependent on the number of generations** separating the pair of haplotypes, which is equal to $2t$ generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the distance to the first recombination event encountered as we move either upstream or downstream of a chosen genomic site is exponentially distributed (with a mean of $t$=50cM). This is because with TMRCA of $t$ generations and recombination rate of 1 per Morgan per generation, we expect $2t$ recombination events per Morgan on each side of the segment. \n",
    "The total length of the shared segment is therefore distributed as the sum of two independent exponential random variables of mean $t$=50cM (i.e. the Erlang-2 distribution).\n",
