## Workshop: Genomics of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) Segments

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a practical workshop on the genomics of IBD segments. 

### Workshop Content

The workshop is divided into three main parts:

1. **Identification of IBD Segments**
   - Introduction to IBD concepts
   - Simulation of genetic data
   - Detection and visualization of IBD segments
   - Understanding the relationship between IBD length and TMRCA

2. **Temporal Demographic Inference**
   - Using IBD segments to infer population history over time
   - Simulating demographic events (bottlenecks, expansions)
   - Estimating effective population size changes from IBD patterns

3. **Spatial Demographic Inference**
   - Analyzing population structure using IBD
   - Within- vs. between-population IBD sharing
   - Effects of migration on IBD patterns
   - Visualizing spatial genetic structure
